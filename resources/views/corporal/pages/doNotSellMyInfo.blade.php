                            <p>
                                It is every consumer’s right to add his or her telephone number to the National Do Not Call Registry, which, in general, applies to any plan, program, or campaign to sell goods or services through interstate
                                phone calls. However, a company may call a consumer with whom it has an established business relationship for up to eighteen (18) months after the consumer’s last purchase, delivery or payment, and for up to
                                three (3) months after the consumer submits an application or an inquiry to the company, even if the consumer’s number has been added to the National Do Not Call Registry.

                            <p>
                                <a href="/">Corporalcoverage.com</a> does not make outbound phone calls to consumers, and therefore does not maintain an internal do not call registry of its own. If you no longer wish to receive phone calls from
                                an insurance carrier you got connected with, you will have to contact them directly and request that your telephone number be placed on their specific do not call list.
